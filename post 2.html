                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Problem</h2>
                        <p>The city of Chicago has long been judged based on the murder rate of the city and my boss is interested to see how the homicide rates have affected tourism in the city. This problem was solved by preparing maps of the density of homicides, spatial distribution of the density of Airbnb reviews, and a table of the average AirBnB prices per police district. These maps and table can be utilized to see that areas with lower homicide rates do have more tourism as proven by the amount of AirBnB reviews in the district.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Skills Demonstrated</h2>
                        <p>-	Summary Statistics: Using the summarize tool to create new tables using sum, count, etc.</p>
                        <p>-	Calculate Geometry: Calculating the area of a spatial layer.</p>
                        <p>-	Calculate Field: Calculating a new field by utilizing data from other fields. In this lab, densities were calculated by dividing a value by the area. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How the Problem was Solved</h2>
                        <p>The problem was solved by first calculating the density of homicides reported per square mile. The amount of homicides per district had to be calculated by using the count function for the homicides column and using district as the case field. After this was completed, the new table had to be joined with the district table and then exported to their own layer. In the new table, two fields had to be added: an area field and a homicide density field. The area field was calculated by using the calculate geometry tool, using the area property and the square mile area unit. Next the homicide density field is a calculated by using the calculate field tool and using the equation !homicide_count! / !area!. Finally, a choropleth map is created by using graduated colors under symbology and selecting the homicide density field.</p>
                        <p>The next step to solving the problem was to make a map of the density of AirBnB reviews. The amount of AirBnB reviews per district had to be calculated by using the count function for the reviews column and using district as the case field. After this was completed, the new table had to be joined with the district table and then exported to their own layer. In the new table, two fields had to be added: an area field and a review density field. The area field was calculated by using the calculate geometry tool, using the area property and the square mile area unit. Next the review density field is a calculated by using the calculate field tool and using the equation !review_count! / !area!. Finally, a choropleth map is created by using graduated colors under symbology and selecting the review density field.</p>
                        <p>The final step was to create a table that included the mean price of AirBnBs per police district. This was completed by using the mean function from the summarize tool. The price was the field to use and mean is the statistic type. This created a new table with a district, frequency, and mean columns. </p>
